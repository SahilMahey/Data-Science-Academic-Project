Data-Visualization-Academic-Project


This project is focused on the  Canadian air safety by creating different visualizations on the data set containing information about all commercial and private aviation occurrences (accidents) occurring within Canada over the past 25 years.

This project has been created on one main goal and 2 sub goals :-

Main Goal: Where should efforts be focused to improve the safety of Canadian air space?

Sub-Goal 1: What are the most common types of incidents and accidents in Canadian air space?

Sub-Goal 2: Are there any trends or patterns in incidents and accidents based on geographic regions in Canada?

Skills :- Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Geopandas and Ipywidgets.

COMP 3600 Machine learning Project


This project focuses on analyzing the Wine Dataset, aiming to build and evaluate Classification model (Logistic Regression) based on the quality of wine instances. The investigation primarily revolves around exploring the impact of various data preparation techniques on the predictive performance of the model.

This project uses techniques such as Feature Transformation ( Log and MinmaxScaler) and Feature Selection techniques in order to construct 10 logistic regression classification models on the different predictors of Wine Dataset with the variable quality as the target variable of Classification.

Skills :-  Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, numpy, Matplotlib and Seaborn
